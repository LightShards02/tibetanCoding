# tibetanCoding
I'm Kevin from WHBC, Wuhan, China. I'm a high school student, dreaming of developing something influential.

This is a program to achieve basic programming functions in Tibetan. Traditional programming languages are designed in English, which creates a language barrier for learners in non-English speaking countries. Inspired by Language Yi which supports programming in Chinese, I wanted to develop a similar platform.

This program is a trial of using the Tibetan language instead of English to program. I designed it to help Tibetan users to learn basic algorithmic thinking in their mother tongue context. Considering many users may have limited access to computer science study, I relied on VisualBasic script to lower the threshold of using this platform. (users don't need to download development kit to run their program). 

The program doesn't include many functions. Specifically, it only supported the most basic programming techniques that a new learner will learn in his first programming class:
1. create a variable
2. edit variables' value
3. output a value
4. if statement
5. while statement
6. for...to... statement

Here are some sample codes that can be run with this program(both Tibetan codes and their English pseudocode counterparts):

1.create variable/text output
འགྱུར་ཚད གྱུར = 1
དཔར་རྒྱག གྱུར

(var a = 1
 print a)


2. if statement
འགྱུར་ཚད གྱུར = 1
གལ་སྲིད 5 > 0 ད་གཟོད
གྱུར = གྱུར + 1
ཚར་བ་གལ་སྲིད
དཔར་རྒྱག གྱུར

(var a = 1
if 5 > 0 then
  a = a + 1
end if
print a)


3. do-while
འགྱུར་ཚད གྱུར = 1
བསྐྱར་ཟློས ཙམ་ན གྱུར < 6
དཔར་རྒྱག གྱུར
གྱུར = གྱུར + 1
ཚར་བ་བསྐྱར་ཟློས

(var a = 1
do while a < 6 
  print a
  a = a + 1
end loop)


4. for-to
ནས འགྱུར་ཚད གྱུར = 1 འདང་བ 5
དཔར་རྒྱག གྱུར
ཚར་བ

(for var a = 1 to 5
  print a
end loop)

I'm now still improving this program to make it better. I hope one day, the program can be equiped with more comprehensive functions that enable it to be a mature product.

Thank you for your reading.
